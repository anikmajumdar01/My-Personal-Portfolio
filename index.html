                    <p>In an era defined by the rapid emergence of digital technology, the creation, development and maintenance of user-friendly websites has indeed turned into a challenging task. The traditional, compartmentalized modes of designing professional and competent sites are simply not applicable anymore. Instead, a new demand for full-stack designers with the capability of crafting dynamic, innovative and sophisticated websites has slowly begun to gain significant traction. These designers are required to deal with both front-end and back-end designing processes in an efficient, futuristic and effective way.</p>

                    <h1 class="headings">MACHINE LEARNING</h1>
                    <p>Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. Machine Learning is the study of making machines more human-like in their behaviour and decisions by giving them the ability to learn and develop their own programs. This is done with minimum human intervention, i.e., no explicit programming. The learning process is automated and improved based on the experiences of the machines throughout the process. Good quality data is fed to the machines, and different algorithms are used to build ML models to train the machines on this data. The choice of algorithm depends on the type of data at hand, and the type of activity that needs to be automated. </p>
